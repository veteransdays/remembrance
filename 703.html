        <h2><strong>Poems about remembrance day for primary students Bbc news remembrance sunday</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Remembrance Day</b>. In Flander&rsquo;s Fields. In Flanders fields the poppies blow. Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky. The larks still bravely singing, fly. Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the Dead. Short days ago.  John McCrae. In Flanders fields the poppies blow. Between the crosses, row and row, That mark our place: and in the sky. The larks, still bravely singing, fly. Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the Dead. Short days ago. We lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,  About We Remember. I was commissioned by the Royal British Legion and the National Literacy Trust to write this <b>poem</b> for <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>. I threw myself into research, reading war <b>poetry</b>, watching films about war and going to the Imperial War Museum &ndash; as well as going to the National Memorial Arboretum.  Celebrated on the 11th of November, <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>, known also as the Armistice, is an annual commemoration of the end of WWII. It&rsquo;s usually celebrated with a minute of silence of the fallen soldiers and the symbol of the <b>day</b> is a poppy flower. Use this <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Poem</b> - KS1 to mark this special occasion in class.  The water sings along our keel, The wind falls to a whispering breath; I look into your eyes and feel. No fear of life or death; So near is love, so far away. The losing strife of yesterday. We watch the swallow skim and dip; Some magic bids the world be still; Life stands with finger upon lip;  Here are some <b>Remembrance Day poems</b> to share, and some for your <b>kids</b> including a <b>Remembrance Day Poems</b> printable. <b>Remembrance Day Poems</b> <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>. We wear a poppy. On <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>, And at eleven. We stand and pray. Wreaths are put. Upon a grave. As we remember. Our soldiers brave. Little Poppy. Little poppy. Given to me, Help me keep ...  Join us as we honor the brave soldiers who protected us and gave us peace. Through this short and heartfelt <b>poem</b>, &quot;We Remember,&quot; <b>kids</b> can learn the importanc...  The poppy was first used as a symbol of <b>remembrance</b> over 100 years ago, and it&rsquo;s since become an inseparable part of the <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> celebrations. And why has the poppy become so iconic? That may be because it was such a big part of the <b>poetry</b> from the First World War. It&rsquo;s said that poppies were the only plant to thrive on desolate battlefields, so it&rsquo;s only natural that they should ...  The <b>poem</b> In Flanders Fields, by Canadian Dr John McCrae, was the reason that poppies are now the symbol of <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>, so it is fitting that we read and study <b>poetry</b> for 11th November with children each year, starting from a young age with perhaps just a verse or two.
