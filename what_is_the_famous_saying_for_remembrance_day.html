The <b>poem</b> is also widely known in the United States, where it is associated with Veterans <b>Day</b> and Memorial <b>Day</b> .  The 30 <b>poems</b> featured in this blog post offer diverse perspectives on <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>, each one painting a unique picture of bravery, loss, and hope.

We&rsquo;ll not forget the souls who set us free. <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>. by Damian Robin. We fight in many ways, some stay at home, apart, And wear no uniform except soft flesh. Some train, stand ready, are not called. They have their part.  In Flanders Fields. By John McCrae. In Flanders fields the <b>poppies</b> blow. Between the crosses, row on row, That mark our place; and in the sky. The larks, still bravely singing, fly. Scarce heard amid the guns below. We are the Dead. Short days ago.
