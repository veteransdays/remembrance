        <p>We have several different <b>drama</b> circles. Each includes forty cards, a teacher quick guide, instructions for completing the <b>circle</b>, and a set of discussion questions. Some of our circles are about holidays, celebrations or observances in Canada: Learning Pit: Find it on TpT or BN Shop. <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>: Find it on TpT or BN Shop.  This is why <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> is so important. <b>Drama</b> <b>circles</b> are similar to readers &#39; theatre activities where students read small sections of text. They encourage listening and reading fluency.  This <b>drama</b> activity is all about <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> in Canada. It comes with instructions to run the <b>circle</b>, enough cards for any &hellip; Oct 31, 2022 - Drama circles <b>are</b> a great way to help with reading with expression, listening skills, reading comprehension and building a community.  Themes: <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> (11 November); <b>Remembrance</b> Sunday; remembering the sacrifice of those people who have fought to preserve our freedoms.  If you&rsquo;re looking for something a bit different than a speech, we&rsquo;re planning to use our <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Drama</b> <b>Circle</b>, which can be found in our TpT Store ($USD) or BN Shop ($CAN). We are planning to stand in a giant circle in the gymnasium.  <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> is just one day of the year. We all need to remember the sacrifice of so many people every single day. Weave lessons about Canada&rsquo;s role in major world conflicts throughout language arts and social studies.  <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> is Canada&rsquo;s day to celebrate veterans. Here are 26 monologues written by students! <b>Drama</b> Notebook teamed up with the Canadian Educational Theatre Association and ran a monologue contest for students.  <b>Drama</b> can play an important role in your school&#39;s Remembrance Day activities. There is great potential to perform work prepared in drama class with the whole school as part of official ceremonies and there is tremendous potential to engage students in activities in class to deepen their personal understanding of the significance of Remembrance.  This month we turn our thoughts to <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> and Veterans <b>Day</b>. If you&#39;re looking for meaningful and impactful performances to mark this important time of remembrance, <b>we</b> have a curated list of plays that will help you do just that. </p>        <p>Remembrance day of mother.
