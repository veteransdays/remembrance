        <h2><strong>Why is the last post played on remembrance day Remembrance day song with lyrics</strong></h2>
        <p><b>Played</b> on the bugle, the <b>Last</b> <b>Post</b> is a poignant tune performed at <b>remembrance</b> services worldwide. Jeremy Pound explores its significance.  The main reason the Last Post and Reveille bugle calls were used during memorial ceremonies and funerals, initially came out of necessity. However the reason they are still used to this day is because of the <b>symbolism</b> behind the use of the bugle calls.  Today, the Last Post is played in commemoration of <b>battles</b> wars. It is played on Remembrance Day, on Anzac Day, sounded at the sites of memorials in the United States, and serves as the background song at the funerals and memorials of those lost in service to their country worldwide.  The <b>Last</b> <b>Post</b> is often <b>played</b> at <b>Remembrance</b> services, such as Armistice <b>Day</b> and <b>Remembrance</b> Sunday events, and at military funerals. It is also <b>played</b> every evening in Belgium, under the CWGC&rsquo;s Menin Gate memorial in Ieper, by members of The <b>Last</b> <b>Post</b> association, who have held a short <b>remembrance</b> service there every evening since 1928.  <b>Why is the Last Post </b>performed at <b>Remembrance </b>services? Wherever you are in <b>the </b>world &ndash; be it at <b>the </b>Cenotaph in London or <b>on </b>deployment thousands of miles away &ndash; <b>the Last Post </b>signifies <b>the </b>start of <b>the </b>two-minute silence, a time for peaceful reflection often ending with <b>the </b>playing of Reveille.  &quot;Last Post&quot; is used in public ceremonials <b>commemorating</b> the <b>war</b> <b>dead</b>, particularly on Remembrance Day in the Commonwealth of Nations. In Australia and New Zealand it is also sounded on Anzac Day , usually before the two-minute silence, which concludes with &quot; The Rouse &quot;.  From the mid-19th Century, the Last Post was increasingly played at the <b>funerals</b> of <b>soldiers</b> who had <b>died</b> <b>overseas</b>, where there were no military bands to provide music.  The last note of &ldquo;Last Post&rdquo; marks the beginning of the two <b>minutes</b> of <b>silence</b>. During the silence, no musical instrument shall be played, including bagpipes, as this detracts from the purpose of the event which is the quiet reflection on the service and sacrifice of the dead.  The Last Post will be played all over the world on Remembrance Day. But as Alwyn W Turner explains, its origins had nothing to do with <b>mourning</b>. </p>        <p><a href="./137.html">Remembrance day art hub</a>.
