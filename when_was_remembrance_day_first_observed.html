        <h2><strong>When was remembrance day first observed October 15th infant loss remembrance day</strong></h2>
        <p>Today, on <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>, Defence joins all Australians to observe one-minute silence to acknowledge, honour and remember those who have served our country in all wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations. This year marks 110 years since the start of the First World War, in what was Australia&rsquo;s costliest conflict. After four years of continuous fighting, the guns of the Western Front fell ...  mes of peace, conflict, and war. <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> honours those who fought for Canada in the First World War (1914&ndash;1918), the Second World War (1939&ndash;1945), the Korean War (1950&ndash;1953), the Gulf War (1990&ndash;91), in Afghanistan (2001&ndash;2014), and in Peacekeeping Missio.  We pray for all who in bereavement, disability and pain continue to suffer the consequences of fighting and terror. We remember with thanksgiving and sorrow those whose lives, in world wars and conflicts past and present, have been given and taken away.  The <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> &quot;<b>speech</b>&quot; is the stage of the Remembrance <b>Day</b> ceremony called the &quot;address&quot;. Some brief tips for those arranging for or preparing such an address are provided in the Commemorative address section of the DVA&#39;s pdf document &#39;Organising a commemorative ceremony&#39;.  Nov 8, 2024. Shutterstock. To honour <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>, we&rsquo;re sharing Alison Carter&rsquo;s story, For Idle Hands. First published in The People&rsquo;s Friend November 10, 2021. Set in 1921. Keeping busy seemed the best way to cope in the aftermath of war . . . THERE was always money, Minnie thought, but it was always somebody else&rsquo;s money.  In the aftermath of this global tragedy, November 11th at 11 am gained a sacred significance. Known initially as Armistice <b>Day</b>, the date became a universal reminder of the enormous sacrifice made by the millions who served and fell. Over 70 million people were mobilized in World War I, and tragically, between 9 and 13 million lives were lost ...  You can recite the Ode and other poetry on Anzac <b>Day</b>, <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> and other important days. We often use well-known wartime poetry. Sometimes students read original works at a school ceremony. We do this to recognise and remember the service and sacrifice of our veterans and serving personnel.  On <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>, we acknowledge the courage and sacrifice of those who served their country and acknowledge our responsibility to work for the peace they fought hard to achieve. During times of war, individual acts of heroism occur frequently; only a few are ever recorded and receive official recognition.  <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> comes out of the Armistice which ended the First World War. The Armistice came into effect at 11am on 11 November 1918 &ndash; the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Beginning in 1919, that date and time became a moment to stop, reflect and commemorate the millions who died in that war. </p>        <p>Remembrance day silhouette drawing.
