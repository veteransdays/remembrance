Well-known wartime <b>poetry</b> is often used during commemorative services. The Ode is the 4th stanza of the <b>poem</b> For the ...  Words for Remembrance <b>Day</b>. The words of Laurence Binyon. They shall grow not old. They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning. We will remember them. Laurence Binyon, 1869 - 1943. From Laurence Binyon&#39;s <b>poem</b> For the Fallen, written in ...  We Shall Keep the Faith. by Moina Michael, November 1918. Oh! you who sleep in Flanders Fields, Sleep sweet - to rise anew! We caught the torch you threw And holding high, we keep the Faith With All who died.

Remember, Remember&hellip;. by Susan Jarvis Bryant. No thankful foot falls on the London street. In honour of our brave and voiceless dead. <b>Remembrance </b>Sunday&rsquo;s rendered incomplete. Without the steadfast march and sombre tread. Of those who know the bullet-ridden cost. Borne in blood and bone in barbarous wars. For liberty our land has almost lost.  For the Fallen. England mourns for her dead across the sea. Fallen in the cause of the free. And a glory that shines upon our tears. Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow. They fell with their faces to the foe. Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. We will remember them.  For the Fallen. Robert Laurence Binyon, by artist William Strang. (1) <b>Poem</b> by Robert Laurence Binyon (1869-1943), published in The Times newspaper on 21 September 1914. With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children, England mourns for her dead across the sea. Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her spirit, Fallen in the cause of the free. </p>        <p><a href="https://veteransdays.github.io/remembrance/846.html">Powerful remembrance day images</a>. <a href="https://veteransdays.github.io/remembrance/170.html">Remembrance day prayer children</a>.
