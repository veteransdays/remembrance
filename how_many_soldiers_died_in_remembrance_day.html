Remembrance Day is commemorated in many countries, particularly members of the Commonwealth, including Australia and New Zealand (where it is also referred to as Armistice Day).  History of Remembrance <b>Day</b>. Armistice <b>Day</b> or &ldquo;Remembrance <b>Day</b>&rdquo; as it has come to be known, originated following the end of the First World War.

It is also a statutory holiday in three territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut) and in six provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador). </p>        <p>Remembrance day remembered poem.
