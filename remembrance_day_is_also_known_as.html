Lesson plans, <b>short</b> activities and whole school projects to explore <b>Remembrance</b> through poetry and <b>story</b>, art, music, original photographs and film, including Book Club resources for KS2 and KS3.  Nov. 11 is <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>. Here are 11 books that explore the experience of war and its impact on human life.  Remembrance Day comes out of the <b>Armistice</b> which ended the First World War. The Armistice came into effect at 11am on 11 November 1918 &ndash; the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Beginning in 1919, that date and time became a moment to stop, reflect and commemorate the millions who died in that war.  Read <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> soldier stories of sacrifice and bravery as we commemorate the fallen. Discover real World War history.  <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> and Veterans <b>Day</b> can be difficult for young children to understand. Reading age-appropriate <b>stories</b> help them understand history, the concepts of war, peace and gratitude. Here are some stories that I have read to my students to make November 11th more meaningful.  The 30 poems featured in this blog post offer diverse perspectives on <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>, each one painting a unique picture of bravery, loss, and hope. As we delve into these verses, let&rsquo;s not forget the immense sacrifices made by countless individuals in service of their nations.  This was the family&rsquo;s Remembrance Day. The day they set aside every year to remember the short life <b>of</b> <b>Alisha</b> Ann Drayton, Steve and Emma&rsquo;s youngest daughter, who, fifteen years ago today, had died at the age of five from acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Anne Michaels is an award-winning Canadian poet and novelist who just published her long-awaited third novel, &ldquo;Held.&rdquo; The <b>story</b> spans 115 years and deals in themes familiar to her work ...  I grew up in Canada, and we <b>called</b> <b>November</b> <b>11</b>, <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b>, not Veterans Day. I&rsquo;m an American citizen now, and I do appreciate the sacrifices of the US men and Women in the Armed Forces. But November 11, will always be Remembrance Day to me.
