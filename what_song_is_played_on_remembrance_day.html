        <h2><strong>What song is played on remembrance day What is closed on remembrance day in canada</strong></h2>
        <p>The sombre <b>ceremonies</b> included a minute&#39;s silence at 11am, marking the 11th hour of the 11th <b>day</b> of the 11th month of 1918, the moment when guns fell silent across the Western Front and the war ended.  For over 100 years now, <b>every</b> <b>November</b> <b>11th</b>, Canada and other nations around the globe, commemorate the day the Armistice of the First World War was signed. To avoid making a faux-pas, while honouring our heroes, here are the facts, dos and don&rsquo;ts of Remembrance Day.  On Remembrance Day, public ceremonies and church services often include the playing of &ldquo;<b>Last</b> Post&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;Reveille,&rdquo; a reading of the fourth stanza of the poem &ldquo;For the Fallen,&rdquo; and two minutes of silence at 11 a.m. Wreaths are laid at local war memorials and assemblies are held in schools.  The best way to prepare for a successful POW/MIA remembrance <b>ceremony</b> is to do your homework. In a remembrance service, the script is traditionally read by just one person &mdash; an American Legion Auxiliary member (usually the chaplain) or a Legionnaire, and the table is set before the meeting begins.  In the UK, Remembrance <b>Day</b> is held every year on the second Sunday of November. Remembrance <b>Day</b> grew from, and is also closely linked to, Armistice <b>Day</b>. Armistice <b>Day</b> is November 11. It marks the signing of the First World War-ending Armistice on November 11, 1918. Armistice <b>Day</b> was originally dedicated to the memory of all fallen Commonwealth ...  The National Remembrance <b>Day</b> <b>Ceremony</b> will take place at the National War Memorial on Monday, November 11. The <b>ceremony</b> will begin at approximately 10:30 am. You can attend in person or watch the <b>ceremony</b> live on the Royal Canadian Legion&rsquo;s Facebook page and local and national news broadcasts.  Every <b>November</b> during Veterans&rsquo; Week, schools and community groups across Canada hold ceremonies to remember the sacrifices and achievements of those who have served our country in uniform. Events like these that pass on the traditions of remembrance are also important ways to show our appreciation to Veterans and their families.  The order of <b>service</b> is the program of events for a commemorative ceremony or service. You can use this order of service on Anzac Day, Remembrance Day and other important days. We do this to recognise and remember the service and sacrifice of Australia&rsquo;s veterans and serving personnel.  <b>The</b> Remembrance <b>Day</b> Aide Memoire is a <b>guide</b> that provides a general history of Remembrance <b>Day</b> and the ceremonial guidelines on how the Canadian Armed Forces conduct remembrance <b>ceremonies</b>. </p>        <p>Colouring remembrance day.
