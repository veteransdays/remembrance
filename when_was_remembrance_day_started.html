        <h2><strong>When was remembrance day started Remembrance sunday 2024 aberdeen</strong></h2>
        <p><b>The &ldquo;Ode</b> of <b>Remembrance</b>&rdquo;, also known as simply &ldquo;The <b>Ode</b>&rdquo;, is commonly recited at <b>remembrance</b> services in Australia, on Anzac <b>Day</b> (25 April) and on <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> (11 November).  <b>The </b>poem For <b>the </b>Fallen <b>is the </b>source of <b>the </b>line &quot;We will remember them&quot;, recited throughout Australia on Anzac <b>Day</b>. But how much do we remember about <b>the </b>poem itself?  Remembrance Day (also known as Poppy <b>Day</b> owing to the tradition of wearing a remembrance poppy) is a memorial day observed in Commonwealth member states since the end of the First World War to honour armed forces members who have died in the line of duty. [1]  The <b>Ode</b> of <b>Remembrance</b> &ndash; often referred to simply as The <b>Ode</b> &ndash; is actually only the third and fourth stanzas of Laurence Binyon&rsquo;s poem, For the Fallen. He wrote it less than two months after the outbreak of World War I, in response to the heavy casualties suffered by the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front.  The Ode of Remembrance is a <b>poem</b> that is commonly recited at Anzac <b>Day</b> services to commemorate <b>wartime</b> <b>sacrifice</b>. They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning. We will remember them.  What poem is read on Remembrance Day? The Ode of Remembrance is perhaps the most famous of the remembrance day poems. The ode is a section of a longer poem, &lsquo;For <b>the</b> fallen&rsquo; by Laurence Binyon.  The <b>Ode</b> of <b>Remembrance</b> is a poem that is commonly recited at Anzac <b>Day</b> services to commemorate wartime sacrifice. In collaboration with the Australian War Memorial, SBS has recorded translations of the <b>Ode</b> of <b>Remembrance</b> in 45 languages.  <b>November</b> <b>11</b> is observed around the world as a day to remember the sacrifice that countless of people have made in service to their country. Here is how Australia commemorates Remembrance Day.  The fourth stanza - lifted to prominence as &ldquo;The <b>Ode</b> of <b>Remembrance</b>&rdquo; - is engraved on cenotaphs, war memorials and headstones in war cemeteries throughout the English-speaking world. </p>        <p>Remembrance day holiday stat.
