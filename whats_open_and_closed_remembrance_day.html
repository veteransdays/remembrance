        <p>In this lesson, we will learn how <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> is <b>celebrated</b> in the UK. We will learn about <b>Remembrance</b> Sunday and you&#39;ll hear about some of the traditions that exist to commemorate those who lost their lives in the World Wars.  <b>November</b> <b>11</b> is observed around the world as a day to remember the sacrifice that countless of people have made in service to their country. Here is how Australia commemorates Remembrance Day.  <b>Remembrance Day</b> (also known as Poppy <b>Day</b> owing to the tradition of wearing a <b>remembrance</b> poppy) is a memorial <b>day</b> observed in Commonwealth member states since the end of the First World War to honour armed forces members who have died in the line of duty. [1]  What is <b>Remembrance</b> Day? Every year the country comes together for Remembrance <b>Sunday</b>. A period of silence is held at 11am to remember the people who have died in wars around the world.  It is said to represent <b>remembrance</b> and hope. A purple poppy is often worn to remember animals that have died in service, particularly horses, a large number of which were killed during World War ...  <b>Remembrance</b> honours those who serve to defend our democratic freedoms and way of life. We unite across faiths, cultures and backgrounds to remember the service and sacrifice of the Armed Forces community from United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. We will remember them.  Remembrance Day is <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>statutory</b> <b>holiday</b> in Canada. It is also a statutory holiday in three territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut) and in six provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador).  Remembrance Day is a yearly memorial day that is observed in many Commonwealth countries, including Canada, to remember those who died in military service, and honour those who served in wartime. It is observed across Canada each year <b>on</b> <b>11</b> <b>November</b> &mdash; the anniversary of the Armistice agreement of 1918 that ended the First World War .  <b>Remembrance</b> Day &ndash; also known as Armistice Day &ndash; takes place every year, to remember all people who have died in wars. Ceremonies take place on 11 November, the day that World War One ended ... </p>        <p><a href="./203.html">Remembrance day parade altrincham</a>. Halifax what open on remembrance day.
