But how did the distinctive red <b>flower</b> become such a potent symbol of our remembrance of the sacrifices made in past wars?

Poppies were a common sight, especially on the Western Front.  <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> (also known as Poppy Day owing to the tradition of wearing a remembrance poppy) is a memorial day observed in Commonwealth member states since the end of the First World War to honour armed forces members who have died in the line of duty. [1]  A remembrance poppy is an <b>artificial</b> <b>flower</b> <b>worn</b> in some countries to <b>commemorate</b> their <b>military</b> personnel who died in war. Remembrance poppies are produced by veterans&#39; associations, which exchange the poppies for charitable donations used to give financial, social and emotional support to members and veterans of the armed forces.
