        <h2><strong>Why were veterans and their families initially the few that observed remembrance day Childrens talk for remembrance sunday</strong></h2>
        <p>The first <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Day</b> was <b>observed</b> on November 11, 1931. Every year on November 11, Canadians pause in a moment of silence to honour and remember the men and women who have served, and continue to serve Canada during times of war, conflict and peace.  By remembering <b>their</b> service <b>and their</b> sacrifice, we recognize the tradition of freedom these men and women fought to preserve. They believed that <b>their</b> actions in the present would make a significant difference for the future, but it is up to us to ensure that <b>their</b> dream of peace is realized.  <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> is always <b>observed</b> officially on November 11, regardless of the <b>day</b> of the week on which it falls. The <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> National Ceremony, like most ceremonies around the nation, is held on <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> itself. However, when <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> falls on a weekday, many communities choose to hold <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> parades or other celebrations on ...  By 1890, every Union state had adopted it. The world wars turned it into a <b>day</b> of <b>remembrance</b> for all members of the U.S. military who fought and died in service. In 1971, Congress standardized the holiday as &quot;Memorial <b>Day</b>&quot; and changed its observance to the last Monday in May.  This day of remembrance was initially known as Decoration <b>Day</b>. The national observance of Decoration Day, in part, is traced to an order by Maj. Gen. John A. Logan, the commander in chief of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), a fraternal organization of Civil War Union veterans.  Veterans and their families gathered in churches and around local memorials, but observances involved few other Canadians. In <b>1928</b>, some prominent citizens, many of them veterans, pushed for greater recognition and to separate the remembrance of wartime sacrifice from the Thanksgiving holiday.  On <b>Remembrance</b> Day, we acknowledge the courage and sacrifice of those who served their country and acknowledge our responsibility to work for the peace they fought hard to achieve. During times of war, individual acts of heroism occur frequently; only a few are ever recorded and receive official recognition.  <b>Veterans</b> <b>and their</b> <b>families</b> gathered in churches and around local memorials, but observances involved <b>few</b> other Canadians. In 1928, some prominent citizens, many of them <b>veterans</b>, pushed for greater recognition and to separate the <b>remembrance</b> of wartime sacrifice from the Thanksgiving holiday.  Remembrance Day, observed on November 11th each year, holds immense importance for a multitude of reasons. Here are a few key aspects that make this day significant: <b>Honoring</b> <b>Sacrifice</b>: Remembrance Day serves as a poignant reminder of the tremendous sacrifices made by our servicemen and women throughout history. </p>        <p><em>Why were veterans and their families initially the few that observed remembrance day</em>.
