        <p>The Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust is an annual commemoration designated by the U.S. Congress to mark the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in 1943. In 2024, Holocaust Remembrance Day (Yom Hashoah) is May <b>6</b>, and the Days of Remembrance run from the Sunday before Yom Hashoah through the following Sunday.  The International Holocaust Remembrance Day, or the International Day in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust, is an international memorial day <b>on</b> <b>27</b> <b>January</b> that commemorates the victims of the Holocaust, which resulted in the genocide of one third of the Jewish people, along with countless members of other minorities by Nazi Germany between ...  The United Nations General Assembly designated <b>January</b> <b>27</b>&mdash;<b>the</b> anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau&mdash;as International Holocaust Remembrance Day, a time to remember the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust and the millions of other victims of Nazi persecution.  Listen to or read Holocaust survivors&rsquo; experiences, told in their own words through oral histories, written testimony, and public programs. The US Congress established Days of <b>Remembrance</b> as the nation&rsquo;s annual commemoration of the Holocaust.  <b>The </b>internationally recognized date for <b>Holocaust Remembrance Day </b>corresponds to <b>the </b>27th <b>day </b>of Nisan on <b>the </b>Hebrew calendar. It marks <b>the </b>anniversary of <b>the </b>Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. In Hebrew, <b>Holocaust Remembrance Day </b>is called Yom Hashoah.  The first attempt at a Holocaust remembrance day was <b>a</b> <b>1948</b> decision by the Israeli chief rabbinate that the 10th of Tevet&mdash;an early winter fast day commemorating the beginning of the siege that led to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 bce &mdash;would be the day to recite the memorial Kaddish.  The first Holocaust Remembrance Day in Israel took place <b>on</b> <b>December</b> <b>28</b>, <b>1949</b>, following a decision of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel that an annual memorial should take place on the Tenth of Tevet, a traditional day of mourning and fasting in the Hebrew calendar.  That changed the following <b>year</b>&mdash;<b>exactly</b> <b>20</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> Wednesday&mdash;when Germany became the first European country to declare the date as an official day of remembrance for the victims of...  In Warsaw, the Jewish community marked the beginning of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising on April 19; in Israel, official ceremonies were held at Yad Vashem in April, while in Germany the <b>first</b> official commemoration of the <b>Holocaust</b> took place on November 9, 1978&mdash;the 40th anniversary of Kristallnacht. </p>        <p>Remembrance day 2024 information.
